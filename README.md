# Track-Your-Visits

Track-Your-Visits is a project developed during a weekend-long hackathon during the covid 19 pandemic. It aimed to improve the prediction and tracing of infection chains in order to prevent the spread of viruses. The project focused on providing a service for establishments in public spaces and their visitors to securely record visits using QR code scanning. While the project was not continued beyond the hackathon, it showcased the potential of using digital solutions for contact tracing.
